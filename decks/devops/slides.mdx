# This Talk

1. The problems we are solving
2. Cloud infrastructure
3. Tools of the trade

# Web Applications

```notes
We've been building web apps for ourselves

Story: Build app, put on Heroku, ???, PROFIT

So far, Heroku made this easy
```

# 📈 _Scalable_

# Web Applications

```notes
More users -> more dynos
Horizontal scalability (more later)
More dynos -> more money
```

---

# 💸 _Affordable_

# 📈 Scalable

# Web Applications

```notes
Heroku powered by AWS
AWS cheaper but steep learning curve (more later)
Maybe mention Qubit
```

# 💪 _Resilient_

# 💸 Affordable

# 📈 Scalable

# Web Applications

```notes
If a server falls over in the cloud, and nobody is tailing the logs, does it throw an error?
```

# 🍱 _Manageable_

# 💪 Resilient

# 💸 Affordable

# 📈 Scalable

# Web Applications

```notes
Architecture gets complicated, deployment shouldn't be
```

Humans are unreliable.
Computers are good at doing what you tell them 100% of the time.

# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure

---

<Image src="assets/old-man-yells-at-cloud.png" />

```notes
In-house hosting (old desktops) - mention original Firmstep setup
"The Cloud" (someone else's computer)
Many different providers, but mostly AWS, GCE and Azure
```

---

# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- EC2 (servers)
- RDS (databases)
- S3 (files)
- Route53 (DNS)
- Lambda (serverless)

```notes
An impenetrable mess of brand names, buzzwords and inconsistent UIs.
They have official certifications.
Expensive
```

---

<Image src="assets/aws-services.png" />

---

# Google Cloud Engine (GCE)

```notes
An expensive but extremely powerful platform
```

---

# Azure

```notes
Something something Microsoft
```

---

# Dedicated Servers

- Hetzner
- OVH/Kimsufi

```notes
Manage your own infrastructure
Save yourself a fortune
More to setup
Scaling up becomes challenging
```

---

# Horizontal Scalability

```notes
Autoscaling
Stateful backend problem
```

---

# Tools of the trade

```notes
Freeform section
Overview of things we use
```

---

# "Containerisation"

i.e.

> "we put a computer in your computer"

---

# Docker

is a

> Container management tool

```notes
Fixes the problem of "it works on my machine"
Defines your entire stack down to the operating system level, consistent config
Mention `fusion` @ Qubit vs Docker
```

---

# Continuous Delivery (CD)

a.k.a. Continuous Deployment

```notes
some projects already using
deploy as soon as a build is available
GitHub + Heroku -- webhooks
```

---

# Continuous Integration (CI)

(usually lumped as CI/CD)

```notes
automatic testing
9/10 recruiters don't know the difference
GitHub + CircleCI/Travis/other -- webhooks again
```

---

# Infrastructure-as-code

- Terraform
- Ansible

```notes
Terraform / ansible etc.
Draw parallel with React
```

---

# Logging / Monitoring

```notes
High availability
immediate
searchable

importance of useful metrics
notify the right people at the right time (shifts, pagers etc.)
```

---

# Serverless

- AWS Lambda
- Zeit now.sh

```notes
Still uses a server
Hides details of infrastructure

Instead of express, you expose a request handler
```

```notes
This is not the attitude you want!
The boundary between development and ops is getting narrower ─ cross-skill teams
Better tooling (docker), more automation (CI/CD), less human involvement

"Move fast and break stuff" dropped by FB
