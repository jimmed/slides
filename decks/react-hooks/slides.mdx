# What is React?

```notes
for those non-tech people in the audience
tool for building user interfaces in JS
runs nearly all of our user interfaces
 - mettle app (react native)
 - ops-tool
 - website
 - this presentation
can be used to render anything
 - DOM/web applications
 - mobile applications (android/ios)
 - canvas/webGL (react-three-fiber)
 - command-line tools (ink)
 - music

## Developers ðŸ’œ React

```notes
A lot of developers love react
Built by Facebook to address their own tech issues
- Performance in large applications
- Predictability / reasoning about code
  - Lifecycle model
  - Separation of local state from application state
- Ecosystem
```

## Developers ðŸ¤¬ React

```notes
- Architecture took a long time to settle
- fixed most major issues, but one long standing developer experience issue: re-using behaviours across components
```

## History of React

### July 2013 â”€ v0.3

First public release

```notes
Initial public release v0.3.0
Major design flaws, bugs, warts
Mixins!
```

---

```jsx
React.createClass({
  name: "ToggleButton",
  getInitialState() {
    return { toggle: false };
  },
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      toggle: !this.state.toggle,
    });
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.toggle ? "On" : "Off"}
      </button>
    );
  },
});
```

---

## Mixins

```jsx
const ToggleMixin = {
  getInitialState() {
    return { toggle: false };
  },
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      toggle: !this.state.toggle,
    });
  },
};
```

---

## Mixins

```jsx
React.createClass({
  name: "ToggleButton",
  mixins: [ToggleMixin],
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.toggle ? "On" : "Off"}
      </button>
    );
  },
});
```

```notes
Mixins were _the_ way to compose behaviours
Kinda worked, a few problems
```

---

## History of React

### December 2013 â”€ v0.8

```notes
Published to npm v0.8.0
Nice christmas gift
Reliable enough to build applications with
```

Published on npm

---

## History of React

### Oct 2015 â”€ v0.14

Separated into `react` and `react-dom` packages

```notes
Important step as it realised React as a tool for reconciling trees of elements
```

---

## Stateless Functional Components

```jsx
const MyButton = ({ onClick, toggled }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{toggled ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
);
```

```notes
...also introduced in v0.14
Super small syntax
NO LIFECYCLE
```

---

## History of React

### Apr 2016 â”€ v15

First "stable" release

```notes
Huge performance improvements
Improved SVG support
```

---

<Image size="contain" src="./assets/mixins-considered-harmful.png" />

```notes
Lord and saviour St Abramov of the church of React
 - mixins are horribly broken
 - name clashes
 - pain to manage (dependencies, tight binding + messy at scale)

Solutions:
 - don't use mixins. embed directly or use HoCs
```

---

```jsx
const withToggle = InnerComponent =>
  class extends React.Component {
    state = { toggle: false };

    handleToggle() {
      this.setState({ toggle: !this.state.toggle });
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <InnerComponent
          {...this.props}
          toggled={this.state.toggle}
          onClick={() => this.handleToggle()}
        />
      );
    }
  };
```

```notes
Higher-order components allow composing behaviour
```

---

## SFCs + HoCs

```jsx
const MyButton = ({ onClick, toggled }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{toggled ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
);

const ToggleButton = withToggle(MyButton);
```

```notes
Fixes the clashing + maintainability issues of mixins
Composability possible
```

---

```jsx
const ToggleButtonWithPopover = withPopover(withToggle(MyButton));
```

---

```jsx
const IsThisEvenReallyAButton = _.flowRight(
  withPopover,
  withToggle,
  withCounter,
  withSomethingFromMyReduxStore,
  withCatPhotosFromApi
)(MyButton);
```

```notes
Very powerful pattern
Comes with a cost
Lovely using recompose â”€ ops-tool
```

---

```
<Popover>
  <Toggle>
    <Counter>
      <CatPhotoApi>
        <MyButton />
      </CatPhotoApi>
    </Counter>
  </Toggle>
</Popover>
```

```notes
Can affect performance
Pain to debug
Naming clashes problem resurfaces in passed props
```

---

# Render Props

### a.k.a _children as a function_

---

# Render Props

```jsx
const MyButton = () => (
  <ToggleBehaviour>
    {({ toggled, toggle }) => (
      <button onClick={toggle}>{toggled ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
    )}
  </ToggleBehaviour>
);
```

```notes
Fixes component nesting issue
Moves nesting issue into the render method
```

---

# Enter: Hooks

```notes
A new API for the same React component lifecycle
which can be used inside functional components
```

---

## ~~Stateless~~ Functional Components

    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

```notes
Explain what is going on here
 - functional component
 - weird useState function from react
 - storing single state variable
 - no need for setState
Add a counter
 - many state variables
Extract behaviours out into new hooks
```

---

# `useState`

```jsx
const useToggle = (initial = false) => {
  const [toggled, setToggled] = useState(initial);
  return [toggled, () => setToggled(!toggled)];
};
```

```jsx
const useCounter = (initial = 0) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(initial);
  return [counter, () => setCounter(counter + 1)];
};
```

```notes
can return whatever, but CQRS
```

  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

```notes
- replacement for didmount/didupdate/willunmount
Make the behaviour optional
 - wrap the hook in an if statement first (WRONG)
 - move it inside
 - add dependency
```

---

# `useEffect`

```jsx
const MyOverpoweredComponent = () => {
  const { x, y } = useWindowScrollPosition();
  useDocumentTitle(`Scrolled to (${x}, ${y}`);

  return (
    <div>
      {x}, {y}
    </div>
  );
};
```

```notes
Grouping functionality by _behaviour_ not by lifecycle method
```

---

# `useEffect`

```jsx
const useDocumentTitle = title =>
  useEffect(() => {
    let originalTitle = document.title;
    document.title = title;

    return () => {
      document.title = originalTitle;
    };
  }, [title]);
```

---

# `useContext`

```jsx
const ThemedButton = () => {
  const theme = useContext(MyThemeContext);
  return <button style={theme}>Button</button>;
};
```

```notes
different way of accessing the same context
(not using MyThemeContext.Context)
```

---

# `useReducer`

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg);
```

```notes
The pattern that makes redux powerful
is now sort-of built-in to React.

Good for building FSMs
```

---

<center>

# `useReducer` + `useContext`

<p><em>(+ about 10 lines of code)</em></p>

# `==`

# `redux` + `react-redux`

</center>

```notes
My searing hot take on this
Redux is now pretty much redundant (thanks Dan)
Freedom from global application state; separate reducers + contexts for separate concerns
```

---

# `useRef`

```jsx
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // `current` points to the mounted text input element
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

```notes
Same old refs
```

---

# Other built-in hooks

- `useMemo` / `useCallback` to avoid re-executing expensive functions
- `useLayoutEffect` - blocking version of `useEffect`
- `useImperativeHandle` to expose imperative code to parents

```notes
blocking version => syncly on all DOM renders
imperative handle => escape hatch for forward refs
```

---

# Hooks allow you to...

**Organise code by behaviour**, not by lifecycle method

---

# Hooks allow you to...

**Compose behaviours** and re-use them.

---

# Hooks allow you to...

Use well-tested 3rd party modules to add complex behaviours without:

- sacrificing control of rendering
- introducing performance overheads

---

# Hooks allow you to...

Never write another `class` in React again.

---

## Apollo (via `react-apollo-hooks`)

```js
// Query
const { data, error, loading } = useQuery(GET_CATS);
```

```js
// Mutation
const toggleLikedCat = useMutation(TOGGLE_LIKED_CAT, {
  variables: { id: catId },
});
```

---

## Apollo (via `react-apollo-hooks`)

```js
// Subscription
const { data, error, loading } = useSubscription(CAT_LIKE_COUNT_CHANGED, {
  variables: { id: catId },
});
```

---

## Redux (via `react-redux@next`)

```js
// select data from store
const cat = useSelector(state => state.cats[catId]);
```

```js
// dispatch actions to store
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const toggleLikedCat = dispatch({ type: CAT_LIKE_ACTION, catId });
```

---

## etc.

```js
const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage();
const { width, height, top, left } = useClientBoundingBox(elementRef);
const { x, y } = useMousePosition(); // useScrollPosition()
const { data, isLoading, error } = useFetch(CAT_API_URL);
useOnClickOutside(elementRef, closeModal);
```
