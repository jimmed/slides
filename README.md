# Teaching Slides

I teach full-stack JavaScript web development, for [CodeYourFuture][cyf], [Constructor Labs][cl] and in my spare time.

This repository allows me to quickly get a new slide-deck up and running online with minimum overhead.

## Slides

All slides are written in [MDX][mdx] format, to be rendered using [mdx-deck][mdxdeck].

Slides are available for the following talks:

- [Node.js](./decks/cyf-node/)

Note that a lot of these slides make little sense without me talking in front of them, but the source code is left here as a reference for my students, or anybody else who is curious.

## Deployment

This project is configured to be deployed using [now 2.0][now], hooked directly up to GitHub for that warm continuous delivery glow.
